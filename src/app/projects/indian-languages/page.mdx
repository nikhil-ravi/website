# Indian Languages

The Indian constitution recognizes 22 languages as official languages. The 2011 census lists 1369 "mother tongues" spoken in India. The following treemap shows the number of speakers of each language. The size of the box represents the number of speakers. The colors are supposed to represent the language family, however, since there are so many languages, neighboring language groups have similar colors. The data is from the 2011 census.
