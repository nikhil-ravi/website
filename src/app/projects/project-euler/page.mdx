# Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about), named after the renowned mathematician Leonhard Euler, offers a series of intriguing mathematical and programming problems that go beyond traditional curriculum boundaries. While mathematical insights pave the way for elegant solutions, the use of computer programming skills becomes imperative for tackling most challenges.

I am using this page to document my solutions to the problems I have solved so far. Unless otherwise stated, all solutions are written in Python 3.11 and up.
