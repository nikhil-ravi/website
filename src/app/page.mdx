# nikhil ravi

Ph.D. student at Cornell University, immersed in the realm of privacy-preserving optimization algorithms for networked dynamic systems. My research primarily revolves around enhancing the robustness and privacy aspects of energy systems, with a focus on developing innovative solutions.

Currently seeking opportunities in quantitative research and data ML science for
Spring 2024, I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills to impactful projects
at the intersection of academia and industry.
